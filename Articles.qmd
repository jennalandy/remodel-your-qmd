title: "Writing Articles with Quarto"

## Setting Up Template

You can find [templates made by quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/) and [others](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html) for many popular journals (PLOS, ASA, Elsevier, ...).

1.  Set up a article with a journal template in your terminal:

        quarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier

2.  It will ask you what to call the sub-directory for your article files:

        Directory name: â€º my_elsevier_article

3.  *One small change* --- add the line `pdf: default` in the YAML for it to compile without error:

    ![](images/image-98481140.png){width="216"}

## Writing Your Article

When writing your article in Qaurto, you can use

-   **markdown** (headers with `#`, bold with `**`, italics with `*`, etc.)

-   **citations and cross references** (with `@`)

-   **LaTeX formulas** (with single or double dollar signs `$$`)

-   **R code to include plots and tables**

If you use Quarto in your everyday research workflow, it will be a quick transition to writing a paper with Quarto.
