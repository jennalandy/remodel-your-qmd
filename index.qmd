These materials are intended as part of a training session on document preparation with Quarto and Rmd in RStudio.

The session will start by introducing RStudio, setting up a R project, creating a Quarto document, defining the YAML, and a orientation to formatting options and adding code.

I will present the materials of the website side by side with the `.qmd` files in RStudio. The materials go through useful features for preparing documents in RStudio:

1.  Packages for pretty tables and animated plots
2.  Making the final product prettier and easier to navigate with themes, references, table of contents, etc.
3.  How to use Quarto to write a full journal article.
